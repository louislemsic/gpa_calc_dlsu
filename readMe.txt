==1==
subjects.txt is not required. 
for fast input of grades, I suggest having one 
but again, it is not required.

subjects.txt format:

<subject code><space><units><new line>
<subject code><space><units><new line>
  .
  .
  .
<EOF>


==2==
Input Grades that will affect your GPA only. 
Don't include anymore the extra ones.


==Patch Notes==

1.0. Simple User Interface. All functions are working. It just executes a simple GPA calculator.
1.2. Added a print txt function, save settings function, and a confidentiality checker.

1.3. Added a logo and some strict input checkers. If numbers are asked, only numbers could be entered.
